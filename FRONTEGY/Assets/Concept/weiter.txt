WeiterPhase: 1 n :weiterFrame
WeiterFrame: 1 n :

remove troop. have multiple units on a tile.

battle. every weiterFrame should have a method that returns a list of battles that result from that frame.


weiterobserver.
weiterobserver should handle everything. gamemaster should only instantiate and update it?
weiterobserver.update returns true => it is done.

VISUALLY:
non-conflicting units: go to their next tile.
conflicting units: go into special position. if moving & not gathering, go to border
idea: make teams move turn-based, only good in PvE (which game should be)

Show conflict areas




IDEA (maybe a good one for once):
Make class View. This class contains a certain event in wobs, like movement to next tile, showing conflict areas, and actual battle.

View state:

bool update: bool do_virtual_tick
virtual bool do_virtual_tick: return true

virtual Vector3 camPos
virtual Quaternion camRot


GameMaster:
BattlePhase bf
bf.update():
if index >= bf.views.length return true
if bf.views[index].update() index++
return false
bf.views:
View weiterRed
View weiterBlue
View showConflicts
View battle0
View battle1
View battle2
...
View summary
return true on update.


Cam should maybe have static configurations? Maybe static interpolations to those as well?

a -> b -> c

1 a.pos.set(new, world)
2 a.pos.set(new, local)
3 a.setParent(new, keepworld)
4 a.setParent(new, keeplocal)


must recalculate:
1: (a) set-world, compute-local. (b) compute-world. (c) compute-world.
2: (a) set-local, compute-world. (b) compute-world. (c) compute-world.
3: (a) compute-local
4: (a) compute-world.            (b) compute-world. (c) compute-world.


system should now not at all call transforms when not necessary.

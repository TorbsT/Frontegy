BATTLE
first: Convert(P, x) & Convert(E, x)
?: first attack against P takes no HP
Phit: Reflect(P)
Ehit: Heal(P, {HP DMG})
Pdeath, trash: Convert(E, x)

---SPELLS---
t = team, u = unit, n = node
d = duration (typically rounds), a = scalar, range, etc

Fog(t, n, d, a) - Covers n and surrounding nodes in a-range in t-fog for d rounds
Cloak(u, d) - Applies CLOAKED to u for d rounds
Freeze(u/n, d) - Applies FROZEN to u or n for d rounds.
Heal(u, a) - u's HP increased by a
Reflect(u) - Reflects all incoming damage for u, to sender
Convert(u, d) - Converts u to the opposing team for d rounds, including effects except itself

---STATUS EFFECTS---
c = concept (role, stats, active cards)

n FOGGED: lingering, applies CLOAKED to friendly units, hides friendly buildings
BOGGED: dump eet
u CLOAKED: tactical: Invisible unless conflict, battle: role never REVEALED?
